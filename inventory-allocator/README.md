## Brandon Zhu - Deliverr Application 2020: Submission

This submission incorporates TypeScript, with some of the basic definitions of Shipments and WarehouseInventory borrowed from users arturnt's commits (in the public git history) to make the submission more understandable and complete. The core functions in InventoryAllocator such as singleWarehouse, multipleWarehouses, and computeProposal are my own work. I also included my own tests in ./src/InventoryAllocator.uspec.ts.
